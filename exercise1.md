## Language

Rust

---

## Question 1

- For stylistic errors, there is rustfmt and for general linting, Clippy.
- For testing, Rust provides some built-in features for testing which includes the `test` attribute, the `should_panic` attribute and other macros.
- For building, Cargo is the build tool for Rust. It bundles all common actions into a single command

## Question 2

Other alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions include

- GitLab CI/CD is a tool for software development using continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.
- Buddy is a web-based and self-hosted continuous integration and delivery software for Git developers.
- TeamCity is a continuous integration server developed by JetBrains.
- AWS CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines for fast and reliable applications.
- Azure DevOps Server is a Microsoft product that provides version control, reporting, requirements management, project management, automated builds, testing and releases management capabilities.

## Question 3

It depends. If it is a small, cloud-based project, Buddy will be my go-to option because it is so easy to set up.
